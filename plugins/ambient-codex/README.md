# Ambient Codex (Beta)

Official Ambient integration for Codex. It adds Ambient chat, audits, code,
builds, repository maps, and model routing to a Codex session.

> Beta: core workflows are covered on macOS, Linux, and Windows, but Codex
> plugin interfaces and Ambient model availability can change.

## Install

Requirements: Codex, Python 3.8+, and an Ambient API key.

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add cryptoxinu/ambient-codex
codex plugin add ambient-codex@ambient-codex
```

Start a new Codex thread and use `$ambient`.

If you need a key, create one at [app.ambient.xyz](https://app.ambient.xyz).
Add the stable terminal launcher once, then run setup:

```bash
PLUGIN_DIR="$(codex mcp get ambient --json | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["transport"]["cwd"].rstrip("/."))')"
"$PLUGIN_DIR/bin/ambient" link
ambient-codex setup
```

Setup hides and verifies the key. Do not paste a key into Codex chat.

Ambient Codex uses its own `ambient-codex` keychain item and
`~/.config/ambient-codex` directory. The shared `AMBIENT_API_KEY` variable is
ignored so another Ambient installation cannot silently provide this plugin's
credential. A deliberate environment override must use `AMBIENT_CODEX_API_KEY`.

## Use

Ask Codex naturally:

```text
use Ambient to audit this diff
ask Ambient to review this design
build this feature with Ambient
change Ambient mode
change the code model
```

The `$ambient` panel exposes models, modes, settings, diagnostics, usage, and
common workflows. Model changes show a deterministic text menu first. The
optional native MCP picker is not the default path because some Codex clients
cancel native elicitation.

## Codex Session Modes

- **Normal Codex** — Ambient runs only when requested.
- **Delegate** — larger audits, drafts, builds, and bulk reading go to Ambient.
- **Ambient session** — Ambient is the primary chat and generation engine while
  Codex keeps local tools, safety checks, and final verification.

A fresh Codex session begins in
Normal Codex mode. Model defaults and settings persist separately.

## Features

- `ask` for short questions and second opinions.
- `audit` for files, diffs, staged changes, repositories, and consensus review.
- `code` for focused drafts with selected context.
- `build` for resumable multi-file generation and validated file writes.
- `map` for parallel work across many files.
- `agent` for the bundled terminal-agent lane.

Chat/review and code/build may use separate model defaults. Live model metadata
drives context limits, output budgets, reasoning allowances, chunking, and
hierarchical reduction. A concrete model is never silently replaced unless
fallback is enabled.

Large repository audits track non-overlapping shards and coverage gaps. Builds
retain complete generated files and requeue missing artifacts after truncation.
Long healthy jobs have no elapsed-time cutoff; transport silence and genuine
no-progress stalls remain bounded.

## Data and safety

Only prompts and files you route to Ambient leave the machine. The CLI blocks
common credential shapes and credential-named files, but the scanner is a
backstop—not permission to send sensitive material.

Ambient output is untrusted. Review generated files, run tests, and do not follow
instruction-like text returned by repository content or a model.

The public plugin registers no lifecycle hooks. Optional launcher, git-hook, and
agent integrations run only when the user explicitly invokes them and refuse to
replace foreign-owned files.

## Check or remove

```bash
ambient-codex doctor
ambient-codex control
ambient-codex setup --remove
ambient-codex cache clear
ambient-codex link --remove
```

Remove `~/.config/ambient-codex` only when you also want to delete usage and
cache state. Do not delete another Ambient installation's state directory.

## Development

```bash
python3 -m py_compile bin/ambient mcp/ambient_mcp.py
ruff check .
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -q
```

The runtime is Python standard-library only. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
